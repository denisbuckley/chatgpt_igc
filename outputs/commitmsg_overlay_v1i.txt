Overlay v1i: cluster-size filter + sized markers

- Adds MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE filter (default 5) to keep only sustained circle clusters.
- Plots sub-threshold clusters faint grey ×; sized black × for n≥MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE.
- Keeps altitude clusters (orange ×, T#) and raw circle midpoints (green ×).
- Writes richer debug with top clusters by n.
