Compare v2d: raw vs filtered circle clusters

- Exposes both views: raw clusters and filtered (nâ‰¥MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE).
- Writes two CSVs: compare_raw_<ts>.csv and compare_filtered_<ts>.csv.
- Also exports cluster summaries for both views.
- Same detectors as overlay; robust dtype/timedelta handling.
